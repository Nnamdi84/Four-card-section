# Four card feature section solution

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 
This is my fourth project. I used the frontend mentor for this. I built the desktop and mobile view with HTML & CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```
```css
.div2 {
background-color: white;
background-image: url("../images/icon-supervisor.svg");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: 90% 80%;
border-top: 5px solid hsl(180, 62%, 55%);
border-radius: .5rem;
box-shadow: 0px 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
padding-inline: 5em;
padding-block: 2rem 7em;
margin: 0 2em 2em 2em;
}
```
